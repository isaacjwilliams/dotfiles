description: Debug a specific test to identify the root cause
---

Run the failing test -- `bundle exec rspec $1` -- then debug the failure.

You may rerun the test, execute scripts with the Rails runner, or add debug logging, but ensure any changes you make while debugging are rolled back before your turn ends. Do not return to me until you are certain of the root cause.
